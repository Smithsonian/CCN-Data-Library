# Guide to Publishing Data with the CCRCN

Interested in publishing your disaggregated soil core data? You've come to the right place! In addition to serving data, we help community members publish their data to Figshare, which is a trusted Smithsonian-affiliated data repository.

To get started, please fill out the [CCRCN Data Submission Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeD_HbOMf82Xx609PrvALYVU9p4vKuSX5J7LPX6ZrWUmNxbHg/viewform?usp=sf_link). This will help us construct a comprehensive metadata file that will accompany the data release.

After completing the data submission application, please send the following to [CoastalCarbon\@si.edu](mailto:CoastalCarbon@si.edu){.email}:

-   Raw, disaggregated data for soil core depth intervals. We will curate this data, however, we encourage that you fill out an accompanying metadata template (template in progress).
-   Completed core-level template or a .csv of your sampling locations at minimum. If you are filling out the template, please include any additional information you may have at the core-level (preferred) or site-level (ex. sampling location, core elevation, salinity, vegetation, species, inundation, or anthropogenic impacts).

[Data Release Preparation:]{.ul}

Sit back and relax! We will contact you with any questions we encounter about your study during the data release preparation.

[Preliminary Data Release:]{.ul}

At this stage, we will have the data and metadata formatted and uploaded to Figshare. We will share a private link to this preliminary data release along with a reserved DOI. Data will be lisenced under CCBY 4.0. **No data will be made public without the permission of the data contributor and the approval of the CCRCN data manager.**

**Want to embargo your data?** We can place a full or partial embargo on your data release once it is prepared and uploaded to Figshare.

See examples of our data releases here [Link to example of data release].

[The data is released! Now what?]{.ul}

After publishing your data, we will ingest it into the CCRCN Data Library, which is a synthesis of soil core data served through the Coastal Carbon Atlas. All attribution is retained.

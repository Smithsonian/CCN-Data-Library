# Coastal Carbon Network Data Library
_An open-source database featuring carbon data from tidal wetlands around the world._

The Coastal Carbon Network (CCN) is a consortium of biogeochemists, ecologists, pedologists, and coastal land managers with the goal of **accelerating the pace of discovery in coastal wetland carbon science by providing our community with access to data, analysis tools, and synthesis opportunities.** We have accomplished this goal by growing iteratively with community feedback, facilitating the sharing of open data and analysis products, offering training in data management and analytics, and leading topical working groups aimed at quantitatively reducing uncertainty in coastal greenhouse gas emissions and storage.

This repository contains the workflows and products of the effort the CCN has conducted to synthesize coastal carbon data from tidal wetland habitats around the world. The current version is CCN Data Library Version 1.0.0.

The CCN serves a broad spectrum of users. As a result, we attempt to make our data products transparent, easy to use, and open-source.

## Citing the Data Library

**Recommended Citation**

Coastal Carbon Network (2023). Database: Coastal Carbon Library (Version 1.1.1). Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.25573/serc.21565671. Accessed (YYYY-MM-DD).

We refer to users as anyone using either data we curate, or synthesis products we create. Data that is curated, but not created, by the Network, should not be attributed to the Network. Users should cite all dataset DOIs and credit the datasetsâ€™ original authors. All synthesis products created by the Network and associated collaborators will be listed under a Creative Commons With Attribution license. The Network should be acknowledged and cited appropriately if users utilize any of the data structures, tools, or scripts developed by Network and associated collaborators. We will develop additional tools to assist users in generating lists of citations, but users will be ultimately responsible for correctly citing all data used. See the [CCN Principles and Governance](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon/principles-and-governance) for more information.

The maintainers of the Coastal Carbon Library do not require, nor expect, offers of co-authorship in exchange for serving this data, only when we make substantial new contributions to a work in line with [CRediT taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/) of roles for collaborations.

## Contribution

Please see the [Data Contribution](https://smithsonian.github.io/CCN-Community-Resources/contributing.html) page on our Community Resources Portal for more details on how to submit data to the CCN Data Library and Atlas.

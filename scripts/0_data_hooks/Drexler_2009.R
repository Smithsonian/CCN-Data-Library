## Read in data #####################

# The original data from the table is stored in the Drexler_et_al_2009_peat_accretion_age_depth.csv file. 
# Because the site-core-sample ID field could not easily be separated using tidy logic, I did it manually in excel
# Additionally, the negative sign character used in the elevation field was causing problems in both excel and R and was replaced with (-)
# That edited file is read in 
# Different computers are having trouble parsing the column names with spaces, leading to errors during cutation. 
# Renaming columns in the read_excel call and skipping the first line which represents the old column names

Drexler, J. Z., de Fontaine, C. S., & Brown, T. A. (2009). Peat accretion histories during the past 6,000 years in marshes of the Sacramentoâ€“San Joaquin Delta, CA, USA. Estuaries and Coasts, 32(5), 871-892.

Issues: 
There are multiple dated cores that do not have carbon stock data from the clearinghouse. 
Age depth intervals do not match up with intervals with carbon stock data. 

The derivative depthseries data joins age-depth to carbon stocks across matching cores and depth intervals. 
This assumes my adjustments of elevation to depth min/max were accurate. 
Additionally, cores that do not have carbon stock data are filtered out. 

Holmquist Notes 2019-04-22: I double checked the adjustments to depth min and max for the dates table and these look good. I changed a couple of the species and methods filenames from Drexler_et_al_2007 to Drexler_et_al_2009. We should move this over from the soils WG to the library as soon as possible since the soil carbon data is accessible via the Holmquist 2018 data release and the dates are available via the Drexler paper. We don't need an additional data release, all data presented is open and citable.

Thirty-six of these cores were processed for aboveground biomass and belowground biomass. Results presented here are aboveground biomass. Results for belowground biomass are presented in file STP-LENS-2009-below-biomass. The remainder 36 auger cores were processed for bulk density and bulk organic content (from loss on ignition, LOI) and results are presented in STP-LENS-2009-geotechnical.}

Dated cores pulled in to soils WG by DK on 2019-03-13. Associated methods and metadata and curation by ML

2019-05-03 JH Notes: There are issues with the species table. The study indexes species at the site leve. THe stable does not have site_ids it has core_ids and species for W4 are missing. I could fix this easily but first wanted to see if this traces back to a more improtant issue we need to fix with the library.

2019-05-09 ML: Used supplementary data to build curated depthseries data. Species table updated. Check age and age_sd variables: I infered from the paper that the age listed uses the date of core collection as year zero.

CCRCN_V2.1.1_depthseries.csv - Contains raw depth-series information for all cores.
CCRCN_V2.1.1_species.csv - Contains information on the dominant plant species at coring locations.
CCRCN_V2.1.1_impacts.csv - Contains information on the anthropogenic impacts at site or coring locations.

metadata.xml - Contains a full suite of descriptive metadata with all attribute and variables defined, units clarified, and geographic, temporal, and taxonomic coverages described according to Ecological Metadata Language Standards. (TO BE INCLUDED)

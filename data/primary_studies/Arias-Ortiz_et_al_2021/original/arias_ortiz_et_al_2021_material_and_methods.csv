The core volume sampled was estimated as the product of the core tube area (pi*r2) and the slicing-thickness (h); sample mass used for LOI ranged from 0.5 to 1g; estimated fraction organic carbon calculated using LOI% to Corg% relationship: Corg% = 0.513*LOI%-1.9,alpha,mass accumulation,custom box model,selected samples,"A box model approach similar to the CRS model was used, but missing excess 210Pb inventories had to be inferred from historic wetland soils in the same area. The box model was based on the annual atmospheric flux of 210Pbxs estimated for the area and calculated from the mean 210Pbxs inventory of six dated intact wetland soils in a nearby location. We confirmed our estimate with data from direct measurements of 210Pbxs atmospheric deposition in artificial collectors in Berkeley, California. The box model was applied to calculate the 210Pbxs inventory (It) expected to have accumulated since restoration (t) at each site. Through this method we could locate the year of restoration (known date) in our soil depth profiles, which was equivalent to the depth at which these inventories (It) were met.

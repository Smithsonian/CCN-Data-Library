The data release contains tidal wetland soil carbon profiles. The data itself is housed in five separate .csv files which can by joined by the core_id and/or site_id attributes. 

arias-ortiz_et_al_2021_materials_and_methods.csv - Contains information on materials and methods broken down by study 
arias-ortiz_et_al_2021_cores.csv - Contains positional and descriptive information on core locations.
arias-ortiz_et_al_2021_depthseries.csv - Contains raw depth-series information for all cores.
arias-ortiz_et_al_2021_impacts.csv - Contains information on anthropogenic impacts at coring locations.
arias-ortiz_et_al_2021_species.csv - Contains information on the dominant plant species at coring locations.

metadata.xml - Contains a full suite of descriptive metadata with all attribute and variables defined, units clarified, and geographic, temporal, and taxonomic coverages described according to Ecological Metadata Language Standards.

metadata.html - Is a simplified, visual and interactive version of metadata.xml for display purposes.

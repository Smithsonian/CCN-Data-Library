Dataset Abstract

	 This dataset includes data used to assess marsh vulnerability to sea-level rise by quantifying marsh erodibility along a salinity gradient in the York River in southeastern Virginia. 
	We measured the erodibility of marshes along a salinity gradient in the York River, a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay (Virginia, USA). We chose five marshes along the York River salinity gradient for this study. Salinity decreases upriver from 18 ppt at the Goodwin Islands to 0 ppt at the Pamunkey Indian Reservation. Within these overall sites, we chose sampling locations along tidal creeks 5-10 m wide, with marsh widths beyond 20 meters and consistent elevations across all study sites. We collected samples from both the tidal channel marsh edge and from the marsh interior. Edge sites were located between the tidal channel and any levee (1 m from edge), while interior sites were located at a measured distance of 10-12 m away from the edge site. All field work was done in July-August 2018, except for the collection of cores for belowground biomass at the Sweet Hall Marsh and Pamunkey Indian Reservation marsh edge sites (September 2018) and elevation profiles of the Pamunkey Indian Reservation (March 2020).
	Data tables are: 1) shear strength, 2) aboveground biomass, 3) belowground biomass, 4) LOI (loss on ignition), 5) kinematic GPS data along the transects and 6) averages for each station of variables in tables 1, 3 and 4.

		Description 

			 We used a Humboldt Shear Vane to determine the shear strength of marsh soils. We used a 1 m long shear vane, with a 10 cm-long head for relatively weak marsh soils, and a 5 cm-long head to measure relatively strong marsh soils. The shear vane was turned until the marsh soil was broken, and unitless values on the shear vane were converted to kPa using the manufactures conversion formulas (10 cm head: kPa=shear vane value*10*0.0625; 5 cm head: kPa=shear vane value*10*0.5). Each shear strength profile was one meter long with measurements taken at 10 cm intervals. Ten replicate profiles were taken per marsh location at each study site for a total of 100 total soil shear strength profiles along the York River. 
			We measured elevation profiles for all five sites using RTK GPS across a transect from the marsh edge to the interior. For each site, five ground control points were taken on the marsh edge, 1 meter in from the edge, and in the marsh interior.
			Aboveground and belowground biomass were measured destructively. We collected standing vegetation from three replicate above-ground stem clip plots (25 cm x 25 cm) per marsh location at each study site. Samples were counted for the total number of stems, dried to a constant weight, and separated by species to calculate species richness. Three replicate belowground biomass soil cores (15 cm diameter, 50-70 cm depth) were collected at each location within sites (except for the edge site at the Pamunkey Indian Reservation - only 2 cores were taken), and used to measure belowground root and rhizome biomass. We sectioned cores into 10 cm increments and washed over a 1 mm screen sieve. Live belowground biomass was separated based on color, turgidity, and buoyancy in water. Live belowground biomass was dried to a constant weight, and used to generate belowground biomass profiles for each study site.
			Water content, bulk density, and organic matter content were determined from two Russian peat cores (2 cm diameter, 1 m depth) collected at each sampling location per study site. Cores were sectioned into 1 cm segments for the top 50 cm, every 3 cm for the bottom 50 cm. Samples were dried to a constant weight, homogenized, and combusted for 6h at 550 degrees C to burn off organic material.

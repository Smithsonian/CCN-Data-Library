Fell_et_al_2021,GTMNERRSouthern,We examined soil carbon storage in 2018 for a salt mangrove-marsh ecotone along the northeastern coast of Florida near St. Augustine. We established (12) 1.5m^2 PVC chamber plots with mangroves of similar size/age and (12) with only salt marsh grasses. Southern site contains the highest level and most established mangrove population among the 3 sites. This site has larger sized mangroves with an average mangrove age of 7.4 years.,29.7276472,29.7270194,-81.23975556,-81.240569,saline,measurement,scrub shrub,field observation,low,field observation

We established (12) 1.5m^2 PVC chamber plots with mangroves of similar size/age and (12) with only salt marsh grasses. Middle site contains an intermediate level of mangroves compared with the other sides.,29.83637222222222,29.002319444444446,-81.29475833,-81.295289,saline,measurement,emergent,field observation,low,field observation
Fell_et_al_2021,GTMNERRNorthern,We examined soil carbon storage in 2018 for a salt marsh-mangrove ecotone along the northeastern coast of Florida near St. Augustine. We established (12) 1.5m^2 PVC chamber plots with mangroves of similar size/age and (12) with only salt marsh grasses. Northern contains the lowest level of mangroves with an average mangrove age around 7.3 years.,30.0120361,30.0111778,-81.343925,-81.34465,estuarine,measurement,emergent,field observation,low,field observation

2019-10-31 - J. Holmquist added some data available from the papers including 137Cs activity down core, and 210Pb based CIC accretion rates. Added new guidence for 210Pb-based CIC accretion rates at the core level. The rest of the carbon data is part of the Holmquist et al 2018 dataset and can be joined with this. Need to upload citation for the Elsey-Quirk paper.

* NOSAMS comment: The asterisks indicate that the radiocarbon result was corrected for isotopic fractionation using unreported δ13C values measured on the accelerator. The Fraction Modern reported requires no further correction for fractionation. Stable isotope δ13C results reported in column 12 should not be used to post-correct.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

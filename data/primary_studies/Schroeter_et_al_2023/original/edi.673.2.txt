        These data describe physical and chemical properties of soil samples collected as part of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Mitigation Monitoring Program. Data collection began in 2019 at the San Dieguito Wetland in San Diego County, CA. Additional locations at Tijuana Estuary in San Diego County, CA, Carpinteria Salt Marsh is Santa Barbara County, CA, and Mugu Lagoon in Ventura County, CA were added in 2021. Sampling occurred sporadically at various locations in each wetland. All soil samples were characterized for organic matter content and particle size. Additional properties were characterized for select soil samples.

Overview

The coastal development permit for the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Units 2 and 3 requires Southern California Edison to restore a coastal wetland (San Dieguito Wetlands) as mitigation for the loss of fish resources throughout the Southern California Bight caused by the operation of SONGS. 
The permit establishes biological performance standards that must be met by the wetland for a period equivalent to the operating life of SONGS Units 2 and 3. 
Soil properties were evaluated to assess their possible effect on these performance standards.



Study Sites

Data were collected from various locations at the San Dieguito Wetlands (32°58'33.17"N 117°14'53.68"W) and three reference sites (Tijuana Estuary 32.5699010N, 117.1267120W; Mugu Lagoon 34.1020070N, 119.0970110W; Carpinteria Salt Marsh 34.4011890N, 119.5379900W) as part of a long-term study to evaluate the performance of the restoration project. 
The reference wetlands were chosen to represent relatively undisturbed, natural tidal wetlands within the Southern California Bight. 
Samples were collected sporadically from multiple locations within each wetland.



Sampling Methods

In 2019, soil samples were collected at San Dieguito Wetlands from two regions in the easternmost zone of the wetland restoration project (32.978507960N, 117.242451970W 32.97704863, 117.240728520W). 
Soil samples were collected at four locations spaced 10-20 m apart at four elevations (1.61, 1.76, 1.92, and 2.07 m MLLW). 
At each sampling location (n=32), four soil cores (3.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep) were collected from vegetated and non-vegetated patches and combined into a single sample. 

In 2021, soil samples were collected at San Dieguito Wetlands, Tijuana Estuary, Mugu Lagoon, and Carpinteria Salt Marsh from six tidal creeks and six main channel locations used for annual fish and invertebrate monitoring (see EDI packages:  SONGS Mitigation Monitoring: Wetland Survey – Fish Abundance, SONGS Mitigation Monitoring: Wetland Survey – Invertebrate Abundance). 
At each tidal creek / main channel location, samples were collected at three distances from the main waterway inlet at three relative elevations (low, medium, and high). 
At each sampling location (n=54 at each wetland), four soil cores (3.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep) were collected and combined into a single sample.

All samples were sent to the University of California, Davis Soil Laboratory for analysis. 
The methods for each of the measured soil parameters are reported in detail at https://anlab.ucdavis.edu/methods-of-analysis.

          The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Mitigation Monitoring Program is based at the Marine Science Institute, University of California Santa Barbara.
          Long-term monitoring and evaluation of the SONGS mitigation projects is a condition of the coastal development permit issued by the California Coastal Commission (CCC) for the operation of SONGS Units 2 and 3.
          The Permit requires Southern California Edison (SCE) as majority owner and operating agent of SONGS to design and build mitigation projects that adequately compensate for the adverse effects of the power plant’s once-through seawater cooling system on coastal marine resources.
          UCSB scientists working under the direction of the Executive Director of the CCC are responsible for designing and implementing monitoring programs aimed at determining the effectiveness of these mitigation projects.
          
        
      
      
        
          Funding for the SONGS Mitigation Monitoring Program is provided by SCE as a requirement of their coastal development permit for operating SONGS.

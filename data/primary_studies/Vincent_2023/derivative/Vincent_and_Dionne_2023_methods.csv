gouge auger was used to remove the first 20 cm of soil
at each core location. The gouge auger has an open-face
design that allows it to be inserted without compacting soils.
Each core was visually examined at the time of collection,
and no signs of compaction were observed in any
sample. Cores were cut into four sections, each five
centimeters in length. Core segments were placed in
individual Ziploc bags, stored on ice in coolers, and
transported to the lab for processing. Each core was
placed in individual tins, weighed, and dried at 60 °C
for 3 days to achieve constant weight. Dried cores were
re-weighed to determine bulk density as milligrams per
cubic centimeter. Cores were then combusted in a muffle
oven at 450 °C for 3 h, cooled, and reweighed to
determine organic matter calculated as the proportion of
dry core weight. Carbon storage was calculated as milligrams
carbon per cubic centimeter of soil based on the
equation presented in Craft et al. (1991):
Organic carbon = (0.40)LOI+(0.0025)LOI2"

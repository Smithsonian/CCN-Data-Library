Attached is an excel file with the 17 SET sites David Steinmann and many from the NJTWMN have sampled for soil / carbon analysis.  The raw data can be downloaded for free on our Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL).

KSSL = https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/conservation-basics/natural-resource-concerns/soil/kellogg-soil-survey-laboratory-kssl.  This web link explains our KSSL guidance as well as methods for soil sample analysis.

The data themselves can be downloaded from this web address:  https://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/.  The map here at this link lower on the page might look familiar to the Coastal Carbon Atlas map.  The sample points and data can be queried by state, county, soil series name or User Pedon ID #.  The soil series name is in column B of the attached excel file from David.  The User Pedon ID would look something like this “S2015NJ003001” which is in column A in the attached excel file.  Once you find the data / sample sites you are looking for you can simply put a check mark in the “Lab Pedon Number” box to the left.  You can then generate a report, download the data, etc.  Once you have your sites for download selected you should have a page that looks like this: [scrolling menu? Select the top 4 rows]


At this point after you have selected the top 4 rows you can hit “get report” and you should get the data.  Please let it load if you selected quite a few sites.  I think the shallowest site I downloaded from the KSSL for the NJTWMN data was 217 cm.

## Primary Studies

This directory holds the raw and derived data from each study represented in the synthesis.  Each folder follows the same template:  

**original**: this is the raw version of submitted data that _is never edited_.  
**derived**: this is the curated version of the submitted data, which follows the same multi-level structure as the [CCRCN synthesis](https://github.com/Smithsonian/CCRCN-Data-Library/tree/master/data/CCRCN_synthesis).  
(occasionally, there is also an **intermediate** directory, when a stable version of the data is need mid-processing, or especially when data was digitized via data rescue or extracted from plots.  
**README**: the readme of each primary study should provide the citation of that study (which can also be found in the bibliography, in [.csv](https://github.com/Smithsonian/CCRCN-Data-Library/blob/master/data/CCRCN_synthesis/CCRCN_study_citations.csv) and [.bib](https://github.com/Smithsonian/CCRCN-Data-Library/blob/master/data/CCRCN_synthesis/CCRCN_bibliography.bib) formats) as well as the status of the data: not hooked, in-progress, or stable curation.

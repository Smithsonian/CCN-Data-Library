Dataset Abstract

	These data represent the results of radiometric dating of soil cores from Shark Slough sites, including FCE LTER sites SRS3 and SRS4 and FCE related site NE-SRS1 from November 18, 2005 to February 26, 2006.  Soils from 1-cm depth increments were analyzed for bulk density and stratigraphy.  These analyses contribute to a paleoecological study to quantify past changes in vegetation and soil accumulation in relation to past climate variation, fire occurrences and water management.

Intellectual Rights

	These data are classified as 'Type II' whereby original FCE LTER experimental data collected by individual FCE researchers to be released to restricted audiences according to terms specified by the owners of the data. Type II data are considered to be exceptional and should be rare in occurrence. The justification for exceptions must be well documented and approved by the lead PI and Site Data Manager. Some examples of Type II data restrictions may include: locations of rare or endangered species, data that are covered under prior licensing or copyright (e.g., SPOT satellite data), or covered by the Human Subjects Act, Student Dissertation data and those data related to the FCE LTER Program but not funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under LTER grants #DEB-9910514, and # DBI-0620409. Researchers that make use of Type II Data may be subject to additional restrictions to protect any applicable commercial or confidentiality interests. All publications based on this dataset must cite the data Contributor, the Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program and that this material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation through the Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research program under Cooperative Agreements #DEB-1237517, #DBI-0620409, and #DEB-9910514.

The data release contains sediment carbon profiles from tidal wetlands. The data itself is housed in three separate .csv files which can by joined by the core_id and/or site_id attributes. 

Gundersen_et_al_2024_methods.csv - Contains methodological information on the soil core collection and processing.
Gundersen_et_al_2024_sites.csv - Contains site level characteristic information for all cores.
Gundersen_et_al_2024_depthseries.csv - Contains raw depth-series information for all cores.
Gundersen_et_al_2024_cores.csv - Contains core, or sample-level information for all cores.
Gundersen_et_al_2024_impacts.csv - Contains core level anthropogenic impacts. 
Gundersen_et_al_2024_species.csv - Contains taxonomic information associated with each coring site.

metadata.xml - Contains a full suite of descriptive metadata with all attribute and variables defined, units clarified, and geographic, temporal, and taxonomic coverages described according to Ecological Metadata Language Standards.

metadata.html - Is a simplified, visual and interactive version of metadata.xml for display purposes.

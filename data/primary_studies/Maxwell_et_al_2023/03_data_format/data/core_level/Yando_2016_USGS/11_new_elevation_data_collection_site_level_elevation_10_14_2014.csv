"Below, we've included several statements concerning the ethical use of this dataset. We've adopted the following statement regarding data archiving and sharing from Wright et al. 2004: ""The authors believe that the archiving and sharing of large datasets is important for advancing ecology as a discipline. At the same time, for data sharing to be successful and sustainable, it is imperative that all those involved in data acquisition, archiving and use do so in an ethical manner. In particular, we believe that those individuals whose time, efforts and intellect designed and created the studies are acknowledged appropriately."" Text in quotation from: Wright, I. J., P. B. Reich, M. Westoby, D. D. Ackerly, Z. Baruch, F. Bongers, J. Cavender-Bares, T. Chapin, J. H. Cornelissen, and M. Diemer. 2004. The worldwide leaf economics spectrum. Nature 428:821-827.",,,,,,,,,,,,

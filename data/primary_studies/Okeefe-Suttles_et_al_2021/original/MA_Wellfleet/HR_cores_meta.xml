    <descript>
      <abstract>The Herring River estuary in Wellfleet, Cape Cod, Massachusetts, has been tidally restricted for more than a century by a dike constructed near the mouth of the river. Upstream from the dike, the tidal restriction has caused the conversion of salt marsh wetlands to various other ecosystems including impounded freshwater marshes, flooded shrub land, drained forested upland, and brackish wetlands dominated by Phragmites australis. This estuary is now managed by the National Park Service, which plans to replace the aging dike and restore tidal flow to the estuary. To assist National Park Service land managers with restoration planning, the U.S. Geological Survey collected fourteen sediment cores from different ecosystems within the tidally restricted Herring River estuary (four sites) and an estuary in Wellfleet Harbor near the Herring River dike (three sites) between 2015 and 2017. Collected cores were up to 70 cm in length with dry bulk density ranges from 0.03 to 2.39 grams per cubic centimeter and carbon content 0.23% to 46.25%. Land surface elevation was measured at each site (ranging from -0.149 meters to 1.494 meters relative to NAVD88) to determine the boundaries for each site within current tidal conditions. Gamma counting results for excess lead-210 were used to construct Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) age models to age-date individual depth intervals in the cores. Additionally, gamma counting results for other radionuclides, particularly cesium-137 gave further insight to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed during the past century. This dataset can help evaluate differences among the varied ecosystems and vegetation types to make predictions about potential changes as tidal restoration commences in the Herring River estuary.</abstract>
      <purpose>Sediment cores were collected, age-dated, and their carbon content was measured to calculate vertical accretion and carbon burial rates. Data were collected to facilitate National Park Service restoration planning and provide background data of differences in water level, vegetation types, carbon burial rates, and land-surface elevation between sites.</purpose>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Radionuclide detection limits are specific to an individual sample and are a function of: 1) the detector efficiency at the energy level of the peak being measured; 2) the branching ratio (expected fraction of decay events at the energy level), 3) the background activity within the sample. Detector efficiency was determined from EPA standard pitchblende ore in the same geometry as the samples. Activities of 7Be, 137Cs, and excess 210Pb (i.e. unsupported) were decay-corrected to time of collection. Suppression of low energy peaks by self-absorption was corrected for according to Cutshall and others, 1983. Peak detection, with respect to background activity, is calculated for each radionuclide in the APTEC peak integration spectroscopy software during sample analysis. Generally, measured radionuclide activity greater than or equal to 0.43 (210Pb), 0.18 (226Ra), 2.05 (7Be), and 0.02 (137Cs) dpm/g were accepted as above detection limit for this dataset.

Samples were analyzed for weight percent carbon and nitrogen and the isotopic signature of carbon and nitrogen in organic matter at the University of California - Davis (UC Davis), Stable Isotope Facility (SIF) with an Elementar Vario EL Cube or Micro Cube elemental analyzer interfaced to a PDZ Europa 20-20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer. During analysis, samples were interspersed with several replicates of at least four different laboratory reference materials; these reference materials have a long-term standard deviation of 0.2 per mil for 13C and 0.3 per mil for 15N. Any analysis value below detection is given the numerical value of 0. Any attribute that was not measured for a specific sample is left as a blank cell.

    <logic>Dataset was queried for maximum and minimum values to be sure sample analyses were within expected ranges for the environmental conditions.  Data were plotted to look for any obvious outliers that may have been indicative of analytical error. Samples with questionable results were re-analyzed. Detection limits are defined in the attribute accuracy section of the metadata. Any analysis value below detection is given the numerical value of 0. Any attribute that was not measured for a specific sample is listed as an empty or blank cell. Each sample was treated in the same manner for each analysis.</logic>
    <complete>The dataset is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the abstract. Users are advised to read the rest of the metadata record carefully for additional details. All sample measurements are reported.</complete>

HROC and HRHT: 01/11/2017; MYN, MYUR, and HRCH: 12/11/2017; HRP and HRHK: 07/11/2018. Average vertical accuracy of this method is +/- 5 centimeters.

        <procdesc>A piston coring system was used to collect sediment cores from coastal wetlands in 2015, 2016, and 2017. The PVC core liner (diameter 11 cm, 1-2 m in length) was fitted with a gasketed piston that was placed on the sediment surface. The clear, sharpened core liner was pushed down into the marsh subsurface, while the piston was maintained at the marsh surface via tension on the piston. We visually observed the sediment surface to ensure that the soil column did not compact during collection. Once the core reached the desired depth, the core liner and piston were removed from the marsh with a pulley system. The process date reflects the last occurrence of the work.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>At the end of each core collection date, the sediment cores were immediately returned to the USGS Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center. They were placed in a refrigerator for 1 to 3 days, then split vertically, sectioned at 1 or 2 cm intervals, frozen, and then freeze dried for 7 days, until sediment weights did not change further. Dry bulk density was determined as the dry weight of a known volume of sample. Approximately 5 g of dried sediment sample was blended and homogenized prior to sealing in a jar for a minimum of three weeks and then placed on a planar-type gamma counter for 24 to 48 hours to measure 7Be, 137Cs, 210Pb, and 226Ra at 477, 662, 46.5 and 352 kiloelectronvolts (KeV) energies respectively (Canberra Inc., USA). Detector efficiency was determined from EPA standard pitchblende ore in the same geometry as the samples. Excess 210PB was calculated as the decay-corrected difference between total 210Pb and supported 210Pb (considered to be equal to 226Ra). Activities of 7Be, 137Cs, and excess 210Pb were decay corrected to time of collection, using their respective half-lives. Suppression of low energy peaks by self-absorption was corrected for according to Cutshall and others, 1983. Gamma spectroscopy detection limits were determined in APTEC software for each sample; refer to the attribute accuracy section of this metadata for further details. Values reported are above this limit, while values below are reported as 0. Core sections not analyzed are reported as blank cells. Sediment ages and accretion rates were calculated with the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) excess 210Pb age model, a variant on the advection-decay equation (Appleby and Oldfield, 1978; Goldberg, 1963). This model assumes that 210Pb supply to the sediment surface is constant through time, but allows for changing sedimentation rates, in addition to decay, to control the down-core activity of excess 210Pb. The common form of the CRS model, as derived by Appleby and Oldfield (1978), solves for age based on the distribution of exces 210Pb in the sediment record. Prior to application of the age model, excess 210Pb profiles were evaluated to ensure they were sufficiently resolved to apply the CRS model without bias towards ages that are too old or accretion rates that are too low at depth (Binford, 1990). All gamma analyses were ongoing from 2015 and completed in 2018.

        <procdesc>A subsample of freeze dried sediment (0.5 g) was ball-milled to a fine powder and packaged for analysis at the USGS Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center. Samples were analyzed for Total Carbon and Nitrogen at the University of California-Davis (UC Davis) Stable Isotope Facility (SIF). Weight percent carbon and nitrogen and the isotopic signature of carbon and nitrogen in organic matter was analyzed with an Elementar Vario EL Cube or Micro Cube elemental analyzer interfaced to a PDZ Europa 20-20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer. During analysis, samples are interspersed with several replicates of at least four different laboratory reference material; these reference materials have a long-term standard deviation of 0.2 per mil for 13C and 0.3 per mil for 15N. Analyses occurred concurrently with analyses in the previous process step; after radionuclide analysis was completed on a core, we would begin the total carbon and nitrogen analysis (as other cores were still in the process of being analyzed for radionuclides).</procdesc>

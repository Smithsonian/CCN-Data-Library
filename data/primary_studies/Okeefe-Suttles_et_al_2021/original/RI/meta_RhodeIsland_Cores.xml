      <abstract>The accretion history of fringing salt marshes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, was reconstructed from sediment cores. Age models, based on excess lead-210 and cesium-137 radionuclide analysis, were constructed to evaluate how vertical accretion and carbon burial rates have changed during the past century. The Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) age model was used to date six cores collected from three salt marshes. Both vertical accretion rates and carbon burial increased from 1900 to 2016, the year the data were collected. Cores were up to 90 cm in length with dry bulk density ranging from 0.07 to 3.08 grams per cubic centimeter and carbon content 0.71 % to 33.58 %.</abstract>
      <purpose>Sediment cores were collected and dated, and their carbon content was measured to determine vertical accretion and carbon burial rates.</purpose>

      <attraccr>Radionuclide detection limits are specific to an individual sample and are a function of: 1) the detector efficiency at the energy of level of the peak being measured; 2) the branching ratio (expected fraction of decay events observed at each energy level), 3) the background activity within the sample. Detector efficiency was determined from EPA standard pitchblende ore in the same geometry as the samples. Activities of 7Be, 137Cs, and excess 210Pb (i.e. unsupported) were decay-corrected to time of collection. Suppression of low energy peaks by self-absorption was corrected for according to Cutshall and others, 1983. Peak detection, with respect to background activity, is calculated for each radionuclide in the APTEC peak integration spectroscopy software during sample analysis. Generally, measured radionuclide activity greater than or equal to 0.02 (210Pb), 0.02 (226Ra), 0.03 (7Be), and 0.01 (137Cs) dpm/g were accepted as above detection limit for this dataset.

Samples were analyzed for Total Carbon and Nitrogen on a Perkin-Elmer Series II CHNS/O Elemental Analyzer at USGS Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center. A series of calibration blanks and reference standards were analyzed daily.  Standard reference materials (Algae (Bladderwrack), High Organic Sediment Standard and BCSS-1) were analyzed throughout each set of sample runs. Algae was determined to have an average weight percent carbon (wt%C) of 36.45 and weight percent nitrogen (wt%N) of 1.33, compared to published values of 33.67 ± 0.29 and 1.25 ± 0.0.02, respectively. The High Organic Sediment Standard was determined to have an average wt%C of 7.32 and wt%N of 0.53, compared to published values of 7.45 ± 0.14 and 0.52 ± 0.02, respectively. BCSS-1 was determined to have an average wt%C of 2.26 and wt%N of 0.17 compared to published values of 2.19 ± 0.09 and 0.07 ± 0.003, respectively. Triplicate samples had an average relative standard deviation of 2.9 %C and 3.3 %N. The detection limit was determined as wt%C of 0.18 and wt%N of 0.01.  Any analysis value below detection is given the numerical value of 0. Any attribute that was not measured for a specific sample is left as a blank cell.</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>Dataset was queried for maximum and minimum values to be sure sample analyses were within expected ranges for the environmental conditions.  Data were plotted to look for any obvious outliers that may have been indicative of analytical error. Samples with questionable results were re-analyzed. Detection limits are defined in the attribute accuracy section of the metadata. Any analysis value below detection is given the numerical value of 0. Any attribute that was not measured for a specific sample is listed as an empty or blank cell. Each sample was treated in the same manner for each analysis.</logic>
    <complete>The dataset is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the abstract. Users are advised to read the rest of the metadata record carefully for additional details. All sample measurements are reported.</complete>

        <procdesc>Six sediment cores were collected in coastal salt marshes between 9/9/2016 and 9/12/16. A piston coring system was used, where the core liner (diameter 11 cm, 1-2 m in length) was fitted with a gasketed piston that was placed on the sediment surface. The clear, sharpened core liner was pushed down into the marsh subsurface, while the piston was maintained at the marsh surface via tension on the piston. We visually observed the sediment surface to ensure that the soil column did not compact during collection. Once the core reached the maximum depth (limited by the core tube length or an impenetrable sediment layer), the core liner and piston were removed from the marsh with a pulley system. The process date reflects the last occurrence of the work.</procdesc>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>At the end of each core collection date, the sediment cores were immediately returned to the Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center. They were placed in a refrigerator for 1 to 3 days, then split vertically, sectioned at 1 or 2 cm intervals, frozen, and then freeze dried for 7 days, until sediment weights did not change further. Dry bulk density was determined as the dry weight of a known volume of sample. Approximately 5 g of dried sediment sample was blended and homogenized prior to sealing in a jar for a minimum of three weeks and then placed on a planar-type gamma counter for 24 to 48 hours to measure 7Be, 137Cs, 210Pb, and 226Ra at 477, 662, 46.5 and 352 kiloelectron volts (KeV) energies, respectively (Canberra Inc., USA). Detector efficiency was determined from EPA standard pitchblende ore in the same geometry as the samples. Excess 210Pb was calculated as the decay-corrected difference between total 210Pb and supported 210Pb (considered to be equal to 226Ra).  Activities of 7Be, 137Cs, and 210Pb were decay-corrected to time of collection, using their respective half-lives. Suppression of low energy peaks by self-absorption was corrected for according to Cutshall and others, 1983. Gamma spectroscopy detection limits were determined in APTEC software for each sample; refer to the attribute accuracy section of this metadata for further details. Values reported are above this limit, while values below are reported as 0. Core sections not analyzed are reported as blank cells. Sediment ages and accretion rates were calculated with the Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) excess 210Pb age model, a variant on the advection-decay equation (Appleby and Oldfield, 1978; Goldberg, 1963). This model assumes that 210Pb supply to the sediment surface is constant through time, but allows for changing sedimentation rates, in addition to decay, to control the down-core activity of excess 210Pb. The common form of the CRS model, as derived by Appleby and Oldfield (1978), solves for age based on the distribution of excess 210Pb in the sediment record. Prior to application of the age model, excess 210Pb profiles were evaluated to ensure they were sufficiently resolved to apply the CRS model without bias towards to ages that are too old or accretion rates that are too low at depth (Binford, 1990). All gamma analyses were ongoing from 2016 and completed in 2017.

        <procdesc>A subsample of freeze-dried sediment (0.5 g) was ball-milled to a fine powder and packaged for carbon and nitrogen analysis at the USGS Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center. Sample preparation involved weighing 10-30 micrograms of ball-milled sediment into a tin capsule; encapsulated samples were analyzed for carbon and nitrogen on a Perkin Elmer 2400 Series II CHNS/O analyzer. Standards, blanks and reference sediment with a known carbon and nitrogen content were run to verify results (see attribute accuracy report for further details). These analyses occurred concurrently with analyses in the previous process step; after radionuclide analysis was completed on a core, we would begin the total carbon and nitrogen analysis (as other cores were still in the process of being analyzed for radionuclide).</procdesc>

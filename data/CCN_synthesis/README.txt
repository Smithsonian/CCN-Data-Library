## Welcome to the CCN Data Library Synthesis!This Data Library synthesis is curated and maintained by the COASTAL CARBON NETWORK (CCN) hosted at the SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. If you wish to explore or query this synthesis for a particular subset of data, we encourage you to use the [Coastal Carbon Atlas](https://shiny.si.edu/coastal_carbon_atlas/), a map interface we developed to interface with this synthesis in a more user-friendly fashion.***### Your Responsibility as a Data User The data in this synthesis is curated and provided by the CCN but is not solely attributable to the CCN. Each data source should be credited to the original data contributor(s) and should be cited appropriately in subsequent studies (see CCN_bibliography.bib). While we provide a bibliography file, you are responsible for accurately citing any sources you use. See the CCN [Data Use Policy](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon/principles-and-governance#data-use-policy) for more information. ### Uses of the DataThe downloaded data is provided as-is and are meant for academic use. There is no warranty associated with this download. The CCN data library is subject to amendment, correction, and addition. Please subscribe to our [mailing list](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon/join-the-network), or email CoastalCarbon@si.edu if you would like to be periodically notified of changes. ### Acknowledging the CCNThe maintainers of the Coastal Carbon Library do not require, nor expect, offers of co-authorship in exchange for serving this data, only when we make substantial new contributions to a work in line with [CRediT taxonomy](https://credit.niso.org/) of roles for collaborations. If you benefit from downloading this synthesized data, please credit the [current version](https://doi.org/10.25573/serc.21565671) of the Data Library with the date downloaded, in your papers or derivative products. The following citation is recommended for the database:  Coastal Carbon Network (2023). Database: Coastal Carbon Library (Version 1.3.0). Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.

The data tables present in each download may vary depending on available information for the selected sediment profiles. No data values are represented using 'NA'. Please refer to our online [CCN Database Structure](https://smithsonian.github.io/CCN-Community-Resources/soil_carbon_guidance.html) for detail on attribute and variable definitions and descriptions. - CCN_methods: Contains descriptions of methods and materials used during collection and processing of samples in the field and lab. Included if present for the downloaded data.- CCN_sites: Contains positional and descriptive information associated with each sampling site.- CCN_cores: Core level data includes the positional, descriptive, and environmental information associated with each core.- CCN_depthseries: Contains information and measurements associated with sampling intervals along each core profile.- CCN_impacts: Classification of anthropogenic or other impacts at the site or sampling location where data was collected. Included if present for the downloaded data.- CCN_species: Identification of dominant plant species present at locations of coring. Included if present for the downloaded data.### About the CCNThe [Coastal Carbon Network](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon) seeks to accelerate the pace of discovery in coastal wetland carbon science by providing our community with access to data, analysis tools, and synthesis opportunities. Our activities include bringing data libraries online, creating open source analysis and modeling tools, providing training and outreach opportunities, hosting data synthesis workshops targeted at strategically reducing uncertainty in coastal carbon science issues, and to create a community of practice. For more information please contact: CoastalCarbon@si.edu. Thank you for your interest in the Coastal Carbon Data Library and Atlas.*Contacts:* - Resource Email: CoastalCarbon@si.edu - Network Director: James Holmquist, holmquistj@si.edu - Database Manager: Jaxine Wolfe, wolfejax@si.edu

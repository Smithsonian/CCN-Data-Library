Three derived .csv files:

2. ./data/derivative/Smith_et_al_2015_depthseries.csv
3. ./data/derivative/Smith_et_al_2015_sites.csv

There is extensive diatom inventories associated with this data. Are these relevant for biomass? JH - No.

2019-05-03 JH comments: Everything looks good. Some of the materials and methods were incorrect and incomplete so I added them. 

Depth series was missing site ID so I added it. 

This is approved and ready to get linked into the synthesis.

Issues

They report n and sd for LOI and BD samples with multiple measurements. Our guidence can't handel this but it could if we revised it. 

They also report to use CRS, but also measured Ra226 for the profiles. I think you'd only do this if you were using a different method though. Also, they don't provide an age-depth model. We should look into this more.

Copied over from J Holmquist desktop D: drive on Feb 27, 2019, from the inundation mapping project. This is a subset of the HUC8's that intersect mapped tidal wetlands according to the national wetlands inventory as well as freshwater wetlands and farmed land falling below the mean higher high spring water line (97.5% liklihood and below) as far as I can recall. From experience, this HUC8 file is pretty inclusive of the coastal wetlands and surrounding uplands we're most interseted in.

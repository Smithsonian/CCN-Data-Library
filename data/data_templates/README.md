# Data Submission Templates: How to Use

_contact: klingesd@si.edu_

The data submission templates guide users to submit data that is compliant with CCRCN data structure. See the [CCRCN Data Library Structure page](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon/database-structure) to learn more.  

## Using the macro-enabled excel tempates
(_thesse files are stored in [this dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/bu21woyvobnetjw/AABI2NHxouJ3-R5TfWWKJ65Xa?dl=0), as they are too bulky for the GitHub repository_)  
**Pros of this method:** do not need to navigate back and forth with [CCRCN Data Library Structure page](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon/database-structure), error messages ensure proper input of data.  
**Cons of this method:** less flexibility in what is allowed to be inputted.  

1. Open up the template corresponding to the level of data you will input (core level, materials and methods, etc.)

2. Look at the **coding** sheet on the template, which lists the columns of the template and the acceptable inputs for each column.

3. Navigate to the other sheets in the template and input your data (you can copy and paste too). If an attribute accepts only particular factors, the factors will be displayed as a drop-down when a cell is clicked. If you incorrectly input data into a cell(s), an error message will be displayed explaining what did not conform to the CCRCN structure.  

4. Once data has been fully inputted, press the "Check Workbook" button on the **coding** sheet to see if all mandatory attributes are filled out. If no errors are given, you're all set!

5. Save the file as lastNameOfFirstAuthor_year (e.g. Doe_2018)

6. Upload the file in the appropriate location(s) in the [/data](https://github.com/Smithsonian/CCRCN-Soils-Working-Group/tree/master/data) folder of the repository.


## Using the flat file (.csv) templates
(_these are the files stored here in this folder_)  
**Pros of this method:** you will not receive errors if something is improperly inputted.  
**Cons of this method:** Less guidance provided on data submissions, need to navigate back and forth with [CCRCN Data Library Structure page](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon/database-structure) to understand what each column header means. Higher risk that data will not conform to CCRCN structure. 

1. Open up the template corresponding to the level of data you will input (core level, materials and methods, etc.)

2. Visit the [CCRCN Data Library Structure page](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon/database-structure) to determine what inputs are appropriate for each column, and fill out the template (you can copy and paste too).

3. Save the file as lastNameOfFirstAuthor_year (e.g. Doe_2018)

4. If you have data that does not conform to the CCRCN structure, you can add additional columns in the template, or add this additional data as a different file.

5. Upload the file in the appropriate location(s) in the [/data](https://github.com/Smithsonian/CCRCN-Soils-Working-Group/tree/master/data) folder of the repository.

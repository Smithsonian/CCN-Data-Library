      <abstract>Carbon stocks in mangroves in the Zambezi River Delta of Mozambique (East Africa) were inventoried using a stratified random sampling approach from 2012 to 2016. A total 52 plots containing 287 subplots were objectively distributed using a GIS based spatial decision support system (SDSS) to represent the characteristics of mangroves and the operating constraints within the Delta area. The inventory was designed to provide estimates of above- and below-ground carbon stocks for the entire Delta. Data include species, height and diameter at breast height for overstory, understory and dead trees, mass of woody debris, litter, and ground vegetation. Data to estimate soil carbon and nitrogen content to 2 meters depth are also included.</abstract>
      <purpose>Mangroves are recognized for their numerous ecosystem services and functions that are critical to environmental health and human wellbeing in the regions where they occur and beyond. Although mangroves comprise only 0.7% of the world’s tropical forests, they have been shown to contain globally-significant carbon pools, storing up to five times more carbon than typical upland tropical forests per area. As a result, there is interest in considering mangroves in national climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, yet little research related to climate change and carbon sequestration has been completed in mangroves, especially in Africa. WWF-Mozambique’s project, Sustainable Finance for the Protected Areas System of Mozambique recommended development of a pilot project for carbon sequestration in the mangrove forests of the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique, with aims to conserve mangroves in the Zambezi River Delta through reforestation mechanisms and implementation of sustainable use and management activities with local stakeholders, financed sustainably through carbon markets. The USFS project, The Zambezi River Delta Mangrove Carbon Project: A Pilot Baseline Assessment for REDD+ Reporting and Monitoring is a foundational scientific component of the larger WWF effort, designed to quantify the mangrove carbon stocks to contribute to Mozambique’s REDD+ National Program by building in-country technical capacity and measuring the soil and vegetation carbon pools in the intact mangrove stands within the Zambezi River Delta.</purpose>
      <supplinf>This project was also used to assess the distribution of mangroves and change in distribution over time. The results of these analyses are available in Shapiro et al. 2015. Lidar data were also collected as part of this project for a portion of the Zambezi River Delta; that data along with remote sensing derived canopy height data are available online (Lagomasino et al. 2016).</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) were used for entire inventory process. The field sampling protocols for this project are based on methods developed by CIFOR and USFS (Kauffman and Donato 2012), which was developed based on established forest sampling methodologies and first-applied in Indo-Pacific mangrove forests.

Kauffman, J. Boone; Donato, Daniel C. 2012. Protocols for the measurement, monitoring and reporting of structure, biomass and carbon stocks in mangrove forests. Working Paper 86. Bogor, Indonesia: Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR).</attraccr>
    </attracc>
    <logic>The protocol application for this project was to (a) utilize an established protocol to facilitate comparison with other projects, and (b) to assess whether the protocol needs to be adjusted for use in African mangrove forests. See \Supplements\Field_Methods_East_Africa.pdf for more details.</logic>
    <complete>Missing field data is attributable failure to record information in the field; missing laboratory data are attributable to samples that were compromised during processing. Missing data are denoted with blank cells.</complete>

      <method>
        <methdesc>An objective-based inventory was used to quantify the above and below-ground carbon stocks within the Zambezi River Delta. The forest canopy height (Lagomasino et al. 2016) was used as the basis for implementing a stratified random sampling design. Inventory plots were randomly assigned using a spatial decision support system (SDSS) and published forest inventory methods. A nested plot design was used for the measurements, whereby subplots were located systematically within the plot. The field sampling protocols were designed to facilitate the calculation of carbon stocks in vegetation components and soils. The approach was to estimate biomass using a combination of direct measurements (e.g, litter and ground vegetation biomass) and indirect measurements of diameter and height which were then used to estimate biomass, or in the case of dead wood, measurements to estimate biomass using published guidelines. The mangrove sediments were sampled in the field, to provide a basis for estimated soil carbon to a depth of 200 centimeters (cm). The field sampling was conducted by a large crew during two missions in 2012 and 2013. Plant biomass samples were processed at Eduardo Mondlane Universityto adjust field weights to an oven dry basis. Sediment samples were returned to the Forest Service laboratory, Cordesville, SC to measure bulk density and determination of carbon and nitrogen content. The forest inventory data were processed using generalized allometric equations, because at the time of the project local or regional equations were not available. Data were analyzed 2014-2016.

        <srccontr>This data set provides canopy height estimates for mangrove forests in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique, Africa. The estimates were derived from three separate canopy height models (CHM) using airborne lidar, stereophotogrammetry with WorldView 1 imagery, and Interferometric-Synthetic Aperture Radar (In-SAR) techniques with TanDEM-X imagery. The data cover the period 2011-10-14 to 2014-05-06. Each CHM was resampled to 1 meter x 1 meter to match the spatial sampling of the airborne Lidar data set. All data sets were clipped to the extent of the Lidar coverage and subsequently masked to the regions of mangrove tree cover identified by Giri et al. 2014. Each CHM covered an approximate mangrove area of 6,118 hectares.</srccontr>

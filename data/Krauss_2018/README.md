## Notes and Assumptions


#### Depthseries data

Assumption | Justification | Notes
------------- | ------------- | -------------
Soil core samples are 1 cm long | For radiocarbon work, samples were 1 cm long | 
"Depth (cm) in TFFW_soil_core_data.csv is bottom of core sample | Metadata states "Soil depth of core sample in centimeters" |
Renamed "Compression (%) to compaction_fraction | DK is not too certain of difference between compaction and compression, if any...metadata described this attribute as "measure of soil compression resulting from collecting soil core". Converted % to fraction |
Using Krauss c14 dates and not Jones c14 dates | c14 ages from Krauss and Jones appear to be different for the Jones cores reported | ...this is determined from about 10 minutes of inspection but possibly could use more comparison of raw data (which is difficult because raw Jones data corruped). Because of the sets of concerns we have with the Neotoma Jones data release, I would trust the Krauss dates more; plus, the Jones data only includes some of the cores. However, the Jones data release has modeled ages with min and max, so information is lost by using Krauss dataset. Comparable resolution across the depthseries from what I've checked, however.

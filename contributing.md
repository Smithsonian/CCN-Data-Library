# Contributing Data to the Coastal Carbon Network

Thank you for your interest in contributing data to the CCN! If you would like to make your data discoverable through the Coastal Carbon Atlas, we currently welcome contributions of soil carbon data from coastal wetland habitats that experience tidal influence (or are anticipated to the future). We accept data that is published, soon-to-be published, or unpublished as long as the original measurements can made available (ex. soil profile information is present down to the level of sampling interval). Data that we bring into this synthesis includes both data we curate and data from any outside sources that meet basic availability, archiving, and metadata standards. All attribution to the original authors is retained.

Currently, the Atlas only supports soil core-based carbon data, however, the our Network also engages in the curation, archival, and synthesis of other types of carbon data from coastal wetlands, such as biomass, greenhouse gas flux, soil pore water.

Visit our resource page on [data contribution](https://smithsonian.github.io/CCN-Community-Resources/contributing.html) for more information or contact [CoastalCarbon\@si.edu](mailto:CoastalCarbon@si.edu){.email} with particular inquiries.

### Data Ingestion

If your data is publicly available, please send an email to [CoastalCarbon\@si.edu](mailto:CoastalCarbon@si.edu){.email} with a link to the data release and any associated publications (this may include data that is included in the supplementary information of a publication). All attribution to the original authors will be retained. Ingested data will be aligned to the CCN database guidance.

### Data Publishing

In addition to synthesizing and serving data, the CCN also helps community members publish their data to [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), a trusted Smithsonian-affiliated data repository for long-term archival. If you have unpublished soil core data and would like us to assist you assembling a data release, please contact [CoastalCarbon\@si.edu](mailto:CoastalCarbon@si.edu){.email} and CCN personnel will guide you through the process.

Things to know:

-   All attribution is retained (provenance)

-   We can place a full or partial embargo on your data release

-   CCN personnel will accommodate data contributors needs

-   We seek to represent your data in a way that is FAIR

-   Published data will receive its own DOI

-   Data is licensed under CCBY 4.0

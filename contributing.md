# Contributing Data to the Coastal Carbon Network

Thanks for your interest in contributing data to the CCRCN! We welcome contributions of soil core data from any coastal wetlands. We accept data that is published, soon-to-be published, or unpublished as long as it is available in disaggregated form (i.e. soil profile information is present down to the level of sampling interval). Visit our page on [data submission and joining the network](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon/join-the-network) for more information.

### Data Ingestion

If your data is publicly available, please send an email to [CoastalCarbon\@si.edu](mailto:CoastalCarbon@si.edu){.email} with a link to the data release and any associated publications (this may include data that is included in the supplementary information of a publication). All attribution to the original authors will be retained. Ingested data will be aligned to the CCN database guidance.

### Data Publishing

In addition to synthesizing and serving data, the CCN also helps community members publish their data to [Figshare](https://figshare.com/), a trusted Smithsonian-affiliated data repository for long-term archival. If you have unpublished soil core data and would like us to assist you assembling a data release, please contact [CoastalCarbon\@si.edu](mailto:CoastalCarbon@si.edu){.email} and CCN personnel will guide you through the process.

Things to know:

-   All attribution is retained (provenance)

-   We can place a full or partial embargo on your data release

-   CCN personnel will accommodate data contributors needs

-   We seek to represent your data in a way that is FAIR

[Data Submission Templates: How to Use]{.ul}

1.  Open up the template corresponding to the level of data you will input (core level, materials and methods, etc.)

2.  Fill out the template, referring to the database structure detailed below or the **glossary** sheet on the template to determine what input is appropriate for each column. Please strive to provide data for required attributes whenever possible. If you have data that does not conform to the CCRCN structure, you can add additional columns in the template, or add this additional data as a different file.

3.  Save the file as lastNameOfFirstAuthor_year_template (e.g. Doe_2022_cores)

4.  Once you have completed the templates, please email to data to [CoastalCarbon\@si.edu](mailto:CoastalCarbon@si.edu){.email} and CCRCN personnel will assist you in the rest of the process.

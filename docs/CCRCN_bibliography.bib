	abstract = {Wetland impoundments are created to provide ecological benefits such as water quality improvement, mosquito control, and migratory bird habitat. Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, located on the southwestern shore of the Delaware Bay, is composed of four interconnected wetland management units. Tidal inflow from Delaware Bay to Units I and IV occurs naturally, whereas flow to Units II and III has been restricted by tidal gates since the mid-1980s. To assess the accretionary status of Refuge marshes and inform an ongoing restoration, we investigated soil physical properties and developed 137Cs and 210Pb radiochronologies for cores collected at twelve sites. Results indicate that marsh accretion is driven by a combination of mineral sediment and organic matter accumulation, the relative proportions of which vary among and within the wetland units. Accretion rates (0.11â€“0.54cm/y) were found to be significantly correlated with organic matter accumulation but not with mineral sediment accumulation. These relationships demonstrate that biotic contributions to marsh accretion, such as belowground biomass productivity, must be considered in marsh restoration strategies, in addition to the supply of mineral sediment. At eight of the sites, the contribution of mineral sediment to the total volume of the soils has decreased significantly since the early 1900s, predating the impoundment works, perhaps in association with closure of two tidal inlets by natural processes. By comparison, changes in organic soil volume were relatively small over the same time span. At seven of the sites the marsh is accreting at, to just below, the rate of local relative sea-level rise (0.34Â±0.03cm/y) with potential for submergence on the long term. Additional research at the Refuge is needed to better align measurements of marsh accretion, relative sea-level from tide gauges, and wetland elevation change.},

	abstract = {In coming decades, the global rate of sea-level rise (SLR) is projected to accelerate beyond rates observed over the past several millennia when mangrove wetlands have expanded in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate regions. There is substantial uncertainty about how distinct mangrove ecotypes inhabiting a wide range of geomorphic settings will respond to SLR acceleration, including the thresholds at which they will submerge permanently. In this study, the relative contributions of soil organic and inorganic matter (SOM and SIM) to 210Pb-derived accretion rates were examined at 23 mangrove sites in southwest Florida, USA and the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. These sites are situated atop carbonate platforms where there is wide variation in the availability of SIM (generally marine marl). To account for this variability, research sites were classified by SIM presence based on the SOM content (\%) estimated using loss-on-ignition: organic sites (SOM{\textgreater}70\%), intermediate sites (SOM=40â€“70\%) and mineral sites (SOM{\textless}40\%). SOM accumulation rates were largely the same in the three soil classes during the past century (p{\textless}0.05); however, SIM accumulation rates in the intermediate and mineral sites were approximately 5 and 20 times greater, respectively, than rates in the organic sites. Despite this substantial difference in total mass accumulation rates, accretion rates were not statistically different between soil classes (p{\textless}0.05). Our analysis revealed that the rate of SOM accumulation is the best predictor of accretion rates, while the rate of SIM accumulation primarily predicts soil dry bulk density. These findings indicate that SOM and SIM do not contribute additively to soil volume. This is contrary to findings from North American coastal wetlands broadly, suggesting a unique characteristic of carbonate platform mangrove soils that lack a regular, substantive supply of terrigenous SIM. Overall, accretion rates in the FL sites and a Yucatan site on the Caribbean Sea are maintaining pace with regional rates of SLR over the past 100-year and 50-year timespans, whereas the sites in Celestun Lagoon, MX (located on the Gulf of Mexico) exhibit an accretion deficit. Estimates of regional SLR rates range from 4.6 to 12.2mmyrâˆ’1 by the year 2060. Based on accretion rates observed in the past century, some of these sites may be able to keep pace with the lower SLR estimate, but there is no evidence that any of these sites can match the higher rate.},

	abstract = {To address a paucity of Common Era data in the Gulf of Mexico, we reconstructed {\textasciitilde}1.1m of relative sea-level (RSL) rise over the past {\textasciitilde}2000years at Little Manatee River (Gulf Coast of Florida, USA). We applied a regional-scale foraminiferal transfer function to fossil assemblages preserved in a core of salt-marsh peat and organic silt that was dated using radiocarbon and recognition of pollution, 137Cs and pollen chronohorizons. Our proxy reconstruction was combined with tide-gauge data from four nearby sites spanning 1913â€“2014CE. Application of an Errors-in-Variables Integrated Gaussian Process (EIV-IGP) model to the combined proxy and instrumental dataset demonstrates that RSL fell from {\textasciitilde}350 to 100BCE, before rising continuously to present. This initial RSL fall was likely the result of local-scale processes (e.g., silting up of a tidal flat or shallow sub-tidal shoal) as salt-marsh development at the site began. Since {\textasciitilde}0CE, we consider the reconstruction to be representative of regional-scale RSL trends. We removed a linear rate of 0.3mm/yr from the RSL record using the EIV-IGP model to estimate climate-driven sea-level trends and to facilitate comparison among sites. This analysis demonstrates that since {\textasciitilde}0CE sea level did not deviate significantly from zero until accelerating continuously from {\textasciitilde}1500CE to present. Sea level was rising at 1.33mm/yr in 1900CE and accelerated until 2014CE when a rate of 2.02mm/yr was attained, which is the fastest, century-scale trend in the {\textasciitilde}2000-year record. Comparison to existing reconstructions from the Gulf coast of Louisiana and the Atlantic coast of northern Florida reveal similar sea-level histories at all three sites. We explored the influence of compaction and fluvial processes on our reconstruction and concluded that compaction was likely insignificant. Fluvial processes were also likely insignificant, but further proxy evidence is needed to fully test this hypothesis. Our results indicate that no significant Common Era sea-level changes took place on the Gulf and southeastern Atlantic U.S. coasts until the onset of modern sea-level rise in the late 19th century.},

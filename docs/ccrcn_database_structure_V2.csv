impacts,impacts,Code indicating any major anthropogenic impacts historically and currently affecting the coring location.,optional,factor,"tidally restricted = Tidal flow is muted or blocked by built structures. impounded = Water level is raised artificially by a tidal restriction, resulting in ponding of water on the wetland and or upland surface. managed impounded = Wetland is impounded seasonally, and other times natural or semi natural hydrology occurs. ditched = Tidal hydrology is altered because artificial ditches have been cut to promote tidal flooding and drainage. diked and drained = The wetland has been diked and drained, with or without flapper gates, pumping, or other means. farmed = Managed impoundment or drainage in which wetland has been converted to agricultural land. tidally restored = Tidal flow has been restored by removing an artificial obstruction. revegetated = Wetland vegetation has been reintroduced by replanting on unvegetated surfaces. invasive plants removed = Natural plant communities have been restored by the active removal of invasive plant species. invasive herbivores removed = Tidal wetland vegetation has been managed by the removal of invasive herbivores. sediment added = Elevation has been managed by artificially adding sediment to the site using techniques such as thin layering or sediment diversion. wetlands built = Constructed wetland using sediments such as dredge spoils or other sediment source.",NA,NA,NA,NA

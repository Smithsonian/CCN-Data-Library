Database issues

For the data releases we've been prepping, we haven't been collecting info on whether or not the core represents the full profile.
year, month, day, date redundant
probably should scrap core_ prefix on year, month, day
Activity data are all junked up.

total_pb210_activity_sd and total_pb210_activity_se
cs137_activity_sd and cs137_activity_se
bi214_activity_se and bi214_activity_sd redundant
pb214_activity_sd and pb214_activity_se
age_sd and age_se

be7_activity_sd, am241_activity_sd, th234_activity_sd, pb212_activity_sd, marker_date_sd, bi214_activity_sd, pb210_crs_age_sd

pb214_activity_se_295keV should be pb214_activity_295keV_se

pb214_activity_295keV should not necessarily be something we carry through to the synthesis. In the hook script, if more than one pb214 activity are present, we should 

Depth interval table columns sort wrong. site_id at the end for some reason.

Vegetation class and vegetation notes are redundant for a lot of mangroves and seagrass cores.

De_Iongh_et_al_1995 - incorrectly coded as mangrove in species table
Trettin_et_al_2017 - core_ids missing from species table
Alongi_et_al_2008 - Some mangroves misclassified as seagrass
De_Troch_et_al_2006 - No species name or spp.
Gonneea_et_al_2004 - Mangroves misclassified as seagrass in species table
Grady_1981 -  No species name or spp.
Kristensen_et_al_2000 - Rhizophora mucronata classified as seagrass
Marba_unpublished -  No species name or spp. "Mixed" make it in there.
Thimdee_et_al_2003 - NA called seagrass, should be mangrove

A lot of cores from Sanderman's synthesis are not labelled as mangroves.

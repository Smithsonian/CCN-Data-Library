## CCN Data Submission Templates

The data submission templates guide users to submit data that is compliant with CCRCN data structure. See the [CCRCN Data Library Structure page](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon/database-structure) to learn more. Templates for data entry can be downloaded from the [CCRCN Data Templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14N-7l1s151Qmp4AqQOWtIeMtc3efsYZT?usp=sharing) folder on Google Drive.

[How to Use:]{.ul}

1.  Open up the template corresponding to the level of data you will input (core-level, materials and methods, etc.)

2.  Fill out the template, referring to the database structure detailed below or the **glossary** sheet on the template to determine what input is appropriate for each column. Please strive to provide data for required attributes whenever possible. If you have data that does not conform to the CCRCN structure, you can add additional columns in the template, or add this additional data as a different file.

3.  Save the file as lastNameOfFirstAuthor_year_template (e.g. Doe_2022_cores)

4.  Once you have completed the templates, email your data to [CoastalCarbon\@si.edu](mailto:CoastalCarbon@si.edu){.email} and CCRCN personnel will assist you in the rest of the process. Please send any additional inquiries or feedback to this resource email as well.

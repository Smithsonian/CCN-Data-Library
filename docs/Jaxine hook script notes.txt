Hook Script Notes/Issues

In anticipation of the database paper and transition to an updated version of the database guidance, we are revisiting hook scripts to:
- make sure they all run
- align citations to our new standard of having unique bibliography id
- make sure QAQC tests are in place

QUESTION: Which QAQC functions should be required to run for every hook script?
- current tests: table cols & vars, unique core_id, unique coords, fraction not percent, relational databases (core_id), numeric variables 


HOOK SCRIPT REVIEWS:

Baustian_et_al_2021 - the species table was not included in the output for some reason..if there was a reason for this I can't remember why but its there now. Otherwise looks good!

Lagomasino_et_al_2020 - Corrected citations. All set.

Keshta_et_al_2020 - Corrected citations. All set.

StLaurent_et_al_2020 - Corrected citations. All set.

Nolte_2020 - uncontrolled vars in the core elevation datum: NHN, NAP

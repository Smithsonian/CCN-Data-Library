## 1. Introduction ######################################
# The UI interface is designed to effectively gather study metadata
# and generate detailed templates to faciliate data submissions. 
# Users will be asked broad questions about their data and more specific 
# queries will be generated based on their answers to the first set 
# of questions. 

# Additionally, study metadata will be used to create custom CSV templates 
# that can be downloaded and filled out.
